## Running library.py
library.db should already be populated, but you can also run "drop all.py" to drop all tables and "setup_schema.py" + populate_tables.py to recreate library.db.

To access library functions, run "library.py".


To see schema, see "setup_schema.py".

To see data, see "populate_tables.py".
